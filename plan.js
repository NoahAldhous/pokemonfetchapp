    STILL TO DO 
        onClick of FIGHT button-
            Random move chosen by CPU ✅
            Displays that move- ✅
            Determines which pokemon goes first (pokemon.speed)-✅
                speed could be a modifer to a random number?
                highest speed is 180- so maybe make a random number between 1 + 180 and add SPEED MOD?
            Compares the power of move to HP of enemy- ✅
                if it is higher, kills the pokemon!
                if it is lower, the other pokemon acts!
            Display all this as a BATTLE LOG MODAL (element that renders on top of all others)✅
        Reset. ✅
        Help Section (modal display)
        Store Player and CPU score in Local Storage?
