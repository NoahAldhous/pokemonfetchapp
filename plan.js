    STILL TO DO 
        onClick of FIGHT button-
            Random move chosen by CPU 
            Displays that move-
            Determines which pokemon goes first (pokemon.speed)-
                speed could be a modifer to a random number?
                highest speed is 180- so maybe make a random number between 1 + 180 and add SPEED MOD?
            Compares the power of move to HP of enemy-
                if it is higher, kills the pokemon!
                if it is lower, the other pokemon acts!
                compares move to HP-
                if higher, kills the pokemon,
                if not, both pokemon are wounded, but not defeated (draw)
            Display all this as a BATTLE LOG MODAL (element that renders on top of all others)
        Reset.
